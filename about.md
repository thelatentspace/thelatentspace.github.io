The latent space is a pet-project where I want to share ideas in machine learning, math and computer science that excite me.

## Me

Hi, I am Kumar. I lead the core AI team at [Therapanacea](https://www.therapanacea.eu/), a med-tech startup in Paris. My work revolves around the development of our core AI infrastructure and applied research in generative modelling, image registration and segmentation.

Previously, I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Nikos Paragios](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ztx2zRKJIYwC&hl=en) for my graduate thesis on **a self-supervised method for synthetic CT generation from unpaired MR volumes.**
