# Kumar Shreshtha

I am a Senior AI Research Engineer at [Therapanacea](https://www.therapanacea.eu/), where I lead projects on generative modelling, image segmentation and learning based image registration. Our pilot image segmentation project, [Annotate](https://www.therapanacea.eu/our-products/annotate/), includes over 150 neural networks and is trained on a dataset of 15k+ 3D medical images (both MRI and CT). I am also the creator and maintainer of a large file version control system (VCS) optimized for our huge neural network database.

Previously, I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Nikos Paragios](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ztx2zRKJIYwC&hl=en) for my graduate thesis on **a self-supervised method for synthetic CT generation from MRI** [patented]. The algorithm is the only available commerial solution of it's kind, with the capability to translate intra-organ variabilities and gas cavities from MRI to the generated synthetic CT.
