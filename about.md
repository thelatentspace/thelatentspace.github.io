## Me

Hi, I am Kumar. I lead the core AI team at [Therapanacea](https://www.therapanacea.eu/), a med-tech startup in Paris. My work revolves around the development of our core-AI infrastructure and applied research in generative modelling, image registration and segmentation.

Previously, I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Nikos Paragios](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ztx2zRKJIYwC&hl=en) for my graduate thesis on **a self-supervised method for synthetic CT generation from MRI**.

## The Latent Space

I am a computer scientist and biologist by training and yet somehow a machine learning researcher by trade. This meant that most of my knowledge in the domain was acquired through scraping the web for quality free content. So this blog is an attempt to (hopefully) give something back to the society that has been so helpful to me. The name of the blog is owed to my particular interest in the field of representation learning, but I'll be talking about pretty much everything I find fascinating in machine learning, math, computer science and even medical physics.
